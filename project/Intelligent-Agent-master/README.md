# Intelligent-Agent
EPFL IA Project

## Reactive Agent
We are required to solve Pickup and Delivery Problem using reinforcement learning (Markov Decision Processes) to learn an optimal strategy

## Deliberative Agent
Implement the state-based breadth first search and $A^{*}$ heuristic search algorithms.

## Centralized Agent
Implement the Stochastic Local Search algorithm for the PDP.

## Auctioning Agent
The competition rules are as fellows,

1. The auction house publishes the details of the task, i.e. the pickup city, the delivery city, and the weight of the task are revealed to the agents.2. Every interested agents may then submit bids for the task. The bids are integer numbers, representing the payment that the agent requests for the delivery of the task. 
3. The task is assigned to the agent with the lowest bid and that agent is paid according to his bid.

The task is design and implement the best strategy to beat others.

Our Team(G46) win 2rd in the tournament as it described below,
